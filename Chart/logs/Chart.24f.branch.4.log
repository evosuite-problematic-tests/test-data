* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 15
* Using seed 5000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 0s and 3 generations, 4249 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 15
* Number of covered goals: 15
* Generated 9 tests with total length 20
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 82%
* Writing JUnit test case 'GrayPaintScale_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!
