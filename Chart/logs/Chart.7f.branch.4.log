* Using seed 5000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 13s and 285 generations, 80770 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 74
* Number of covered goals: 74
* Generated 23 tests with total length 102
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 39%
