* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.jfree.data.time.TimePeriodValues
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 74
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 9s and 119 generations, 56852 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 74
* Number of covered goals: 74
* Generated 25 tests with total length 120
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
