* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.joda.time.base.BaseSingleFieldPeriod
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 53
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 1488 generations, 267887 statements, best individual has fitness: 1.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 96%
* Total number of goals: 53
* Number of covered goals: 51
* Generated 28 tests with total length 79
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 96%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 51%
* Writing JUnit test case 'BaseSingleFieldPeriod_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
