  - /d4j/defects4j/framework/projects/Time/lib/org/joda/joda-convert/1.2/joda-convert-1.2.jar
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.joda.time.MutableDateTime
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 151
* Using seed 4000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 1540 generations, 375753 statements, best individual has fitness: 4.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 95%
* Total number of goals: 151
* Number of covered goals: 144
* Generated 98 tests with total length 287
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 95%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 47%
* Writing JUnit test case 'MutableDateTime_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
