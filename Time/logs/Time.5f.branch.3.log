* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.joda.time.Period
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 131
* Using seed 4000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 7s and 47 generations, 22484 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 131
* Number of covered goals: 131
* Generated 70 tests with total length 185
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 28%
* Writing JUnit test case 'Period_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
