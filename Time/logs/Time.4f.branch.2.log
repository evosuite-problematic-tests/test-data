* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.joda.time.Partial
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 134
* Using seed 3000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 61s and 1121 generations, 408757 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 99%
* Total number of goals: 134
* Number of covered goals: 133
* Generated 52 tests with total length 297
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 70%
* Writing JUnit test case 'Partial_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
