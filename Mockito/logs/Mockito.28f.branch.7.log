* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 13
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 102s and 3688 generations, 803279 statements, best individual has fitness: 11.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 31%
* Total number of goals: 13
* Number of covered goals: 4
* Generated 2 tests with total length 10
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 31%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 4%
* Writing JUnit test case 'DefaultInjectionEngine_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
