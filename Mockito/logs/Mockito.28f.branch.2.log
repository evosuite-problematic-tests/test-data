* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 13
* Using seed 3000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 3878 generations, 850474 statements, best individual has fitness: 11.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 31%
