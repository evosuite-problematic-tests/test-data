* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.mockito.internal.util.Primitives
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 7
* Using seed 2000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 0s and 0 generations, 5197 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 7
* Number of covered goals: 7
* Generated 6 tests with total length 13
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 83%
* Writing JUnit test case 'Primitives_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
