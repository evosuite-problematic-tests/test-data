* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.mockito.internal.verification.argumentmatching.ArgumentMatchingTool
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 16
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 102s and 5073 generations, 591284 statements, best individual has fitness: 16.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 6%
* Total number of goals: 16
* Number of covered goals: 1
* Generated 1 tests with total length 1
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 6%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 0%
* Writing JUnit test case 'ArgumentMatchingTool_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!
