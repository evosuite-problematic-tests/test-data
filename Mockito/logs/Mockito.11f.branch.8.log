* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 17
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 5371 generations, 144970 statements, best individual has fitness: 16.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 12%
* Total number of goals: 17
* Number of covered goals: 2
* Generated 1 tests with total length 1
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 12%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 0%
* Writing JUnit test case 'DelegatingMethod_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
