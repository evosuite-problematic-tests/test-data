* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.mockito.internal.util.Timer
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 10
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 6158 generations, 622755 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 90%
* Total number of goals: 10
* Number of covered goals: 9
* Generated 4 tests with total length 11
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 90%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 47%
* Writing JUnit test case 'Timer_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
