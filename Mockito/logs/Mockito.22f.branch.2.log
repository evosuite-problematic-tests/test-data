* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.mockito.internal.matchers.Equality
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 28
* Using seed 3000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 5658 generations, 517119 statements, best individual has fitness: 15.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 43%
* Total number of goals: 28
* Number of covered goals: 12
* Generated 5 tests with total length 8
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 43%
* Generating assertions
