* Search finished after 102s and 119 generations, 24596 statements, best individual has fitness: 271.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 3%
* Total number of goals: 260
* Number of covered goals: 9
* Generated 3 tests with total length 13
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 3%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 0%
* Permissions denied during test execution: 
  - java.lang.RuntimePermission: 
         writeFileDescriptor: 2
