* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 733 generations, 253813 statements, best individual has fitness: 70.125
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 82%
* Total number of goals: 428
* Number of covered goals: 351
* Generated 41 tests with total length 289
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 82%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 21%
