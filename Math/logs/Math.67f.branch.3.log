* Using seed 4000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 203 generations, 133240 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 98%
* Total number of goals: 51
* Number of covered goals: 50
* Generated 20 tests with total length 93
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 98%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 39%
