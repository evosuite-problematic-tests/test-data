* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 3231 generations, 951838 statements, best individual has fitness: 3.666666666666666
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 90%
* Total number of goals: 59
* Number of covered goals: 53
* Generated 20 tests with total length 68
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 90%
* Generating assertions
