* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 18557
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_13803_1546788538/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 157
* Using seed 5000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 2200 generations, 634899 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 97%
* Total number of goals: 157
* Number of covered goals: 152
* Generated 64 tests with total length 149
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 99%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 43%
* Writing JUnit test case 'Complex_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
