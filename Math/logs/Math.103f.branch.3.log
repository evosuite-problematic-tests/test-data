* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 19758
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_10180_1546709327/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 23
* Using seed 4000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 4313 generations, 460390 statements, best individual has fitness: 4.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 83%
* Total number of goals: 23
* Number of covered goals: 19
* Generated 6 tests with total length 11
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 83%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 56%
* Writing JUnit test case 'NormalDistributionImpl_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
