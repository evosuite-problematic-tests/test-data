* Using seed 3000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 2943 generations, 579902 statements, best individual has fitness: 2.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 95%
* Total number of goals: 39
* Number of covered goals: 37
* Generated 15 tests with total length 56
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 95%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 9%
