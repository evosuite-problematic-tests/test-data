* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 161
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 1871 generations, 610632 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 99%
* Total number of goals: 161
* Number of covered goals: 160
* Generated 68 tests with total length 152
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 99%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 50%
* Writing JUnit test case 'Complex_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
