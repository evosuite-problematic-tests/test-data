* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_123364_1546638880/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 99
* Using seed 3000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 30s and 909 generations, 376484 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 99
* Number of covered goals: 99
* Generated 28 tests with total length 165
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 43%
* Writing JUnit test case 'ChiSquareTestImpl_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!
