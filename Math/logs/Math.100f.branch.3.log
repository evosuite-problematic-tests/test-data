* Search finished after 39s and 983 generations, 326593 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 28
* Number of covered goals: 28
* Generated 6 tests with total length 25
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 15%
* Writing JUnit test case 'AbstractEstimator_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!
