* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 30
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 3s and 11 generations, 7485 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
