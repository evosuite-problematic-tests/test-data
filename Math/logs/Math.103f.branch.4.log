* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 23
* Using seed 5000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 4657 generations, 507792 statements, best individual has fitness: 4.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 83%
* Total number of goals: 23
* Number of covered goals: 19
* Generated 6 tests with total length 12
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 83%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 60%
* Writing JUnit test case 'NormalDistributionImpl_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
