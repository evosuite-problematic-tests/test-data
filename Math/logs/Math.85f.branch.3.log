* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_240949_1546707534/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers.UnivariateRealSolverUtils
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 26
* Using seed 4000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 1s and 10 generations, 8369 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 26
* Number of covered goals: 26
* Generated 12 tests with total length 31
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 34%
