* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 14953
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_30150_1545220368/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math3.complex.Complex
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 183
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 900 generations, 317242 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 98%
* Total number of goals: 183
* Number of covered goals: 179
* Generated 77 tests with total length 177
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 99%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 52%
* Writing JUnit test case 'Complex_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
