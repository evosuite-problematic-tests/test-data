* EvoSuite 1.0.6
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.apache.commons.math.ode.AbstractIntegrator
* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 14953
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_220155_1545202296/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.ode.AbstractIntegrator
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 67
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 366 generations, 187995 statements, best individual has fitness: 3.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 91%
* Total number of goals: 67
* Number of covered goals: 61
* Generated 21 tests with total length 99
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 91%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 29%
* Writing JUnit test case 'AbstractIntegrator_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
