* Search finished after 101s and 3587 generations, 985330 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 97%
* Total number of goals: 38
* Number of covered goals: 37
* Generated 8 tests with total length 81
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 97%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 33%
* Writing JUnit test case 'SimplexSolver_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!
