* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_48682_1545664713/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.ode.AbstractIntegrator
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 67
* Using seed 2000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 102s and 204 generations, 164633 statements, best individual has fitness: 7.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 87%
* Total number of goals: 67
* Number of covered goals: 58
* Generated 16 tests with total length 65
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 87%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 30%
* Writing JUnit test case 'AbstractIntegrator_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
