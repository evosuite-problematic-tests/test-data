* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 55
* Using seed 3000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 1s and 3 generations, 5175 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 55
* Number of covered goals: 55
* Generated 20 tests with total length 56
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 62%
* Writing JUnit test case 'Frequency_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
