* Using seed 4000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 1926 generations, 1018196 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 97%
* Total number of goals: 38
* Number of covered goals: 37
* Generated 4 tests with total length 58
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 97%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 28%
