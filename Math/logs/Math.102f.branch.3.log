* Using seed 4000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 85s and 2853 generations, 916653 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 99
* Number of covered goals: 99
* Generated 28 tests with total length 154
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
