* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.optimization.linear.SimplexSolver
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 38
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 102s and 2360 generations, 853297 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 97%
* Total number of goals: 38
* Number of covered goals: 37
* Generated 5 tests with total length 61
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 97%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 31%
* Writing JUnit test case 'SimplexSolver_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!
