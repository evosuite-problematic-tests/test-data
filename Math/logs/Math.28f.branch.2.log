  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_100779_1546631781/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.linear.SimplexSolver
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 54
* Using seed 3000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 23s and 318 generations, 182385 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 54
* Number of covered goals: 54
* Generated 6 tests with total length 85
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 32%
* Writing JUnit test case 'SimplexSolver_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!
