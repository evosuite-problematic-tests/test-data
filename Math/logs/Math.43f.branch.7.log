* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 91
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 6s and 41 generations, 18680 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 91
* Number of covered goals: 91
* Generated 30 tests with total length 107
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 33%
* Writing JUnit test case 'SummaryStatistics_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
