* EvoSuite 1.0.6
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl
* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 18557
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_17991_1546790066/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 25
* Using seed 5000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 1s and 2 generations, 2036 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 25
* Number of covered goals: 25
* Generated 12 tests with total length 23
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 63%
* Writing JUnit test case 'NormalDistributionImpl_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
