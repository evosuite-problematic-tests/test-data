* EvoSuite 1.0.6
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.MultivariateNormalDistribution
* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 18557
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_2704_1546785090/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.MultivariateNormalDistribution
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 31
* Using seed 5000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 3s and 32 generations, 17395 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 31
* Number of covered goals: 31
* Generated 8 tests with total length 48
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 44%
* Writing JUnit test case 'MultivariateNormalDistribution_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
