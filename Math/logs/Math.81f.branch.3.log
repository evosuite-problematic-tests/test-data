* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 19758
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_222036_1546707127/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImpl
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 428
* Using seed 4000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 826 generations, 311351 statements, best individual has fitness: 68.4
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 82%
* Total number of goals: 428
* Number of covered goals: 352
* Generated 40 tests with total length 308
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 82%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 23%
