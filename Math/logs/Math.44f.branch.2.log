* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.ode.AbstractIntegrator
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 67
* Using seed 3000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 222 generations, 142377 statements, best individual has fitness: 3.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 93%
* Total number of goals: 67
* Number of covered goals: 62
* Generated 17 tests with total length 81
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 93%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 35%
* Writing JUnit test case 'AbstractIntegrator_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
