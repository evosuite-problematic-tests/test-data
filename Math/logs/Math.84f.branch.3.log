* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_240120_1546707514/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.MultiDirectional
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 16
* Using seed 4000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 5s and 38 generations, 15116 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 94%

* Number of covered goals: 15
* Generated 4 tests with total length 26
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 12%
* Writing JUnit test case 'MultiDirectional_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
