* EvoSuite 1.0.6
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.apache.commons.math.geometry.euclidean.threed.Rotation
* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 2830
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_108138_1546634076/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.geometry.euclidean.threed.Rotation
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 134
* Using seed 3000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 3365 generations, 1866748 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 99%
* Total number of goals: 134
* Number of covered goals: 133
* Generated 62 tests with total length 240
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 99%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 39%
* Writing JUnit test case 'Rotation_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
