* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers.UnivariateRealSolverUtils
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 26
* Using seed 1000
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 1s and 7 generations, 6672 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
