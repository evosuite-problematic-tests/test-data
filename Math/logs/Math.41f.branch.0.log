* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_14101_1545130426/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 59

* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 101s and 2968 generations, 728260 statements, best individual has fitness: 3.666666666666666
* Minimizing test suite
* Going to analyze the coverage criteria
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 90%
* Total number of goals: 59
* Number of covered goals: 53
* Generated 21 tests with total length 63
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 90%
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 42%
